## Potential Issues and Improvements in main.go

1.  Error Handling

-   Some errors, like err from io.ReadAll or client.Do, are not handled optimally. The server could log and respond more gracefully in these cases.

2.  Headers

-   Forwarding headers from the client to the target server may not work as intended since it happens after the request object is created.

3.  Cache Headers

-   Headers for cache entries may include unnecessary request headers from the client. Using the response headers instead would be more accurate.

4.  Concurrency

-   The current mutex lock implementation is fine for basic use but could be replaced with a more optimized locking mechanism for high-concurrency environments.

5.  Cache Size Management

-   Thereâ€™s no limit on the cache size, which may lead to excessive memory usage.

##  Optimizations Implemented in optimal.go
1.  Improved Error Handling

-   All errors are properly logged and handled gracefully, responding with appropriate HTTP status codes.

2.  Header Management

-   A utility function copyHeaders ensures that headers are copied correctly without mixing client and server headers.

3.  Concurrency Optimization

-   The cache uses a channel-based eviction mechanism to remove the oldest entries when the cache reaches its size limit.

4.  Cache Size Management

-   Introduced a maxSize limit to the cache and used a channel (eviction) to track the order of insertion for eviction.

5.  Timeouts

-   Added a 10-second timeout to the HTTP client to prevent requests from hanging indefinitely.

6.  Flexibility

-   Cache size and TTL are configurable via command-line arguments.
