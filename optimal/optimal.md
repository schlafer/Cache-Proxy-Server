## Issues with main.go and Improvements in optimal.go

1.  Error Handling

-   Some errors, like err from io.ReadAll or client.Do, are not handled optimally. The server could log and respond more gracefully in these cases.

2.  Headers

-   Forwarding headers from the client to the target server may not work as intended since it happens after the request object is created.

3.  Cache Headers

-   Headers for cache entries may include unnecessary request headers from the client. Using the response headers instead would be more accurate.

4.  Concurrency

-   The current mutex lock implementation is fine for basic use but could be replaced with a more optimized locking mechanism for high-concurrency environments.

5.  Cache Size Management

-   Thereâ€™s no limit on the cache size, which may lead to excessive memory usage.
